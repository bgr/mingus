# Getting mingus #

The latest source package (in `tar.gz` format) will always be available in [the download list on this site](http://code.google.com/p/mingus/downloads/list). A windows installer can be found there as well.

The latest source, as well as the windows installer are also available at [Python's Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mingus/), which means you can also use `easyinstall mingus`.

And last but not least: you can choose to check out the latest version from the mingus' subversion repository with the command:

`svn checkout http://mingus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ mingus`



# Recommended Packages #


You may also wish to install LilyPond to generate sheet music: http://www.lilypond.org/

Additionally, you can install fluidsynth for realtime MIDI playback support: http://fluidsynth.resonance.org/trac



# Distributions #


Another option is to let your platform's package manager handle the installation. mingus is available as package under the following distributions / platforms:

  * [Arch](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=23101)
  * [Mac Ports](http://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/python/py26-mingus)
  * [Ubuntu (PPA)](https://launchpad.net/~stefan-canta-game/+archive/ppa)
  * !SuSE


Feel free to send a message to the google group if you have packaged mingus for another distribution.
