# Contact #

## Bug Reports ##

We use the built-in issue tracker like a to-do list, so you may submit any bugs, but also feature requests [there](http://code.google.com/p/mingus/issues/list).

## Mailing Lists ##

Mingus uses Google Groups for most of its communication. The main list, [`mingus-python`](http://groups.google.com/group/mingus-python), is reserved
for questions, suggestions, one-of patches, recommendations and requests, and is also used to announce
new releases with some usage examples.

For automated commit messages, issue tracker updates and general development talk, visit the [`mingus-devel`](http://groups.google.com/group/mingus-devel) group.

Subscribing to this group will keep you informed of all the changes to the code-base and is recommended
for contributors and packagers.

## IRC ##

For development talk you can also visit the #mingus channel on freenode.net.
